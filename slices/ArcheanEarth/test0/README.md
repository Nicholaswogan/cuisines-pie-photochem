The units of the .txt file are as follows.
- `alt` is km
- `press` is bars
- `den` is molecules/cm^3
- `temp` is K
- `eddy` is cm^2/s
- Columns labeled by species are volume mixing ratios.
- Species with "aer" at the end of their name are particles (e.g. H2SO4aer). The column gives the effective particle volume mixing ratio.
- Species with "_r" at the end of their name are particle radii in cm (e.g. H2SO4aer_r)
